        <h1 class="intro-title">Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
        The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process that software teams follow to create applications. It helps ensure that the software is built properly, meets the needs of users and is delivered on time and within budget. The SDLC helps teams stay organised, avoid mistakes and deliver high-quality software.</p>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Planning</span></h2>
        <p>The first important stage involves the team gathering client requirements and gaining an understanding of the user's intended use and expecatations of the software. At this stage, all the features and expectations must be clearly covered to the client. The team also check if the project is feasible in terms of cost, technology and time. A document is created to summarise expectations and requirements. Approval is then sought after, before moving forward.</p>
        <p>Inputs include business cases, stakeholder interviews, feasibility studies and initial client requirements. Outputs include a project feasibility report and a roject plan. The people typically involved are product managers, engineering managers and sometimes senior software engineers to advise on technical feasibility.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Requirements</span></h2>
        <p>Once the requirements are clear, the planning begins. Project managers create a plan that includes what needs to be done, how long it will take, what resources are needed and how to handle any risks associated. This plan acts as a guide for the whole project and team.</p>
        <p>Inputs include the project plan, user stories, stakeholder expectations and compliance requirements. Outputs include a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), functional and non-functional requirements and a requirements traceability matrix. The people involved are product managers, engineering managers and senior software engineers, with input from testers to ensure testability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Design</span></h2>
        <p>At this stage, the softwareâ€™s structure is planned out. The team creates a high-level design showing how the system will work and how different parts will connect. Then, a more detailed design is created to explain how each part will be built. This helps ensure the software will be secure, easy to maintain and meets the requirements.</p>
        <p>Inputs include the approved requirements documents and architectural guidelines. Outputs include architecture diagrams, detailed design documents, database schemas, and UI/UX wireframes or prototypes. The people involved are engineering managers, senior software engineers (for architecture and design) and software engineers who will use the designs to build the system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Development</span></h2>
        <p>Coding begins at this stage. Developers write the code based on the design documents provided. The work is usually split into smaller pieces and different team members handle different parts. The team follows coding standards and uses tools to track changes. Code is reviewed regularly to catch problems early.</p>
        <p>Inputs include design documents, coding standards and development tools. Outputs include source code, unit test cases, version-controlled repositories and technical documentation. The people involved are software engineers (and associate engineers with guidnace) who implement the code, senior software engineers who review it and engineering managers who oversee progress.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Testing</span></h2>
        <p>Testing commences once the software is built. Testers check the software to make sure it works as expected and it doesn't have bugs. Different types of testing are done. Unit testing is used to check individual parts, integration testing is used to check how parts work together and user acceptance testing are used to check if it meets the user's needs. This ensures the software is reliable, secure and performs well.</p>
        <p>Inputs include design documents, coding standards and development tools. Outputs include source code, unit test cases, version-controlled repositories and technical documentation. The people involved are software engineers (and associate engineers with guidnace) who implement the code, senior software engineers who review it and engineering managers who oversee progress.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Deployment</span></h2>
        <p>After successful testing, the software is ready to go live. It is moved to the production environment where real users can access it. The deployment might be done all at once or in phases, depending on the agreed strategy. The team ensures everything runs smoothly during this process.</p>
        <p>Inputs include the tested software build, deployment plan and infrastructure setup. Outputs include the live production system, deployment reports, release notes and rollback procedures if needed. The people involved are engineering managers (coordinating deployment), software engineers (executing the release) and testers (performing smoke tests in production).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Maintenance</span></h2>
        <p>After the software is launched; the team fixes any bugs that appear, make updates based on user feedback and ensure the system stays secure and performs well over time. Maintenance helps keep the software useful and up to date.</p>
        <p>Inputs include the tested software build, deployment plan and infrastructure setup. Outputs include the live production system, deployment reports, release notes and rollback procedures if needed. The people involved are engineering managers (coordinating deployment), software engineers (executing the release) and testers (performing smoke tests in production).</p>
