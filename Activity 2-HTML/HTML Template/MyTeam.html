        <h2><span class="stage-title">My Role</span></h2>
        <p>I am one of two Associate Engineers in team Thundercats. The other Associate Engineer is called Jazir Ladha and has been with the team for almost two years. We are both level C3 Engineers. As Associate Engineers our roles are to support the team by working on well-defined tasks while gradually building our technical skills. As an Associate Engineer in Thundercats, I contribute to existing systems under supervision. I am in the process of learning how to operate effectively within a professional software development environment.</p>
        <p>I am also responsible for making changes to existing codebases, CI pipelines and infrastructure, but with guidance from more experienced team members. As I develop, I will begin writing clean, testable code and start to understand the importance of key practices such as security, testing and system performance.</p>
        <p>I also assist in diagnosing technical issues using logs and monitoring tools and am encouraged to suggest simple fixes for operational problems. I also contribute to testing efforts by writing unit tests and learning how to apply different types of testing, such as unit, integration and component testing in different environments.</p>
        <p>In addition, to the technical work I contribute to, I actively participate in code reviews, team discussions and design sessions to learn from others and build collaborative skills. It is also my responsibility to begin to understand how software solutions align with business goals and, with support, start identifying opportunities for improvements or new technologies.</p>

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Senior Software Engineers</span></h2>
        <p>Suchitra Kaipillil is the Senior Software Engineer in our team. Suchitra plays a key role in ensuring smooth delivery of initiatives from inception to deployment. She engages with stakeholders to gather and clarify requirements, provide technical guidance and propose effective solutions. She manages development, testing and deployment workflows through structured ticketing, while proactively identifying risks and blockers that could affect timelines or deliverables.</p>
        <p>She also supports team members by helping resolve technical issues and unblocking development challenges and keep Engineering Management regularly informed of progress, outcomes and any impediments. She also monitors the technical health of our services by identifying tech debt, security concerns and areas for continuous improvement. Additionally, she supports sprint ceremonies and oversees the timely delivery of assigned initiatives. Suchitra works to ensure strong cross-team alignment and helps minimise disruption during complex, interdependent initiatives. By assessing the impact of changes across services and proactively communicating with stakeholders, she helps maintain stability and preparedness throughout the delivery process.</p>
        <p>In addition, she collaborates closely with the Engineering Manager during planning to evaluate requirements, address risks and coordinate with dependent teams. This helps ensure our initiatives are well-executed, supports multi-team collaboration and contributes to the successful delivery of strategic goals across Sainsburyâ€™s.</p>

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Software Engineers</span></h2>
        <p>There are four Software Engineers in team Thundercats, with varying lengths of service and expertise/ skill sets. The four Software Engineers are named; Nowshad Ahmed, Milena Wisniewska, Poulomi Mukherjee and David Mcpherson. They are all level C4 Engineers. Their core responsibilities include contributing to team initiatives through coding, code reviews and technical investigations. They also respond to incidents to maintain system reliability; supporting junior team members in their development; keeping stakeholders informed on the progress of initiatives they lead; and ensuring documentation remains up to date.</p>
        <p>The work that the Software Engineers deliver directly supports the wider team and contributes to project success by driving initiatives forward to enable timely delivery, maintaining trust with consumers through swift incident resolution and promoting team resilience and knowledge growth through mentorship. Keeping stakeholders updated ensures transparency and allows for early course correction when needed. Up-to-date documentation empowers both new team members and data consumers to access accurate information independently, reducing reliance on direct support and improving overall efficiency.</p>
        <p> I interact with the Software Engineers in my team frequently as they are my buddies. They are usually my first port of call for assistance on tickets I am workng on. I also pair-work/shadow them to learn valuable skills and knowledge from them.</p>

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Product Manager</span></h2>
        <p>Greg Kacev and Simone Trubian are team Thundercats' Product Managers. The Product Managers define the product vision, strategy and roadmap; ensuring the team understands the business objectives behind what we build. They create adaptable roadmaps that align with changing priorities and guide delivery timelines. By engaging with customers and stakeholders, they make informed decisions about feature prioritisation to maximise value.</p>
        <p>They coordinate closely with development, business and design teams to set clear expectations and ensure aligned delivery. Post-launch, they monitor product performance through metrics and user feedback, using insights to drive continuous improvement and iterate effectively. Their role acts as the bridge between business, technology and design; ensuring cohesive communication and aligned priorities across teams. For engineering, they streamline development through clear prioritisation and coordination. For business teams, they ensure their goals and customer needs are reflected in the product direction.
        <p>By setting clear goals, driving strategy and owning the product lifecycle, they help deliver meaningful outcomes, reduce misalignment and support the successful execution of initiatives across the organisation.</p>
        <p> I interact with our Team's Product Managers (Greg & Siomone) on some occasions; to gain further clarity about specific initiatives I maybe working on.</p>

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Tester</span></h2>
        <p>Sai Kavuri is our team's only Tester Engineer. His role and responsibilities consist leading end-to-end testing of complex data flows spanning multiple interconnected systems; from the source system (RMS) to end-user platforms such as GOL and the Tu Website. He designs and executes component-level tests to validate the integrity of data ingestion through to downstream publishing.</p> 
        <p>Additionally, he provides cross-team support for testing, service migrations and upgrades, particularly where data exchange with our system is involved. He also integrates Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools like SonarQube and Checkmarx to promote secure, high-quality, and maintainable code through continuous automated analysis.</p>
