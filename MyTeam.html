        <h2><span class="stage-title">My Role</span></h2>
        <p>I am one of two Associate/Junior Engineers in my team. My main role is to support the team by working on well-defined tasks while gradually building my technical skills. I contribute to existing systems under supervision. I am in the process of learning how to operate effectively within a professional software development environment.</p>
        <p>I am also responsible for making changes to existing codebases, CI pipelines, and infrastructure, but with guidance from more experienced team members. As I develop, I will begin writing clean, testable code and start to understand the importance of key practices such as security, testing and system performance.</p>
        <p>As an Associate Engineer, I also assist in diagnosing technical issues using logs and monitoring tools and am encouraged to suggest simple fixes for operational problems. I also contribute to testing efforts by writing unit tests and learning how to apply different types of testing, such as unit, integration and component testing.</p>
        <p>In addition, to the technical work I contribute to, I actively participate in code reviews, team discussions and design sessions to learn from others and build collaborative skills. It is also my responsibility to begin to understand how software solutions align with business goals and, with support, start identifying opportunities for improvements or new technologies.</p>
