        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Zainab, but everyone knows me as Zee. I am an Associate Engineer and work as a back-end developer at Sainsburyâ€™s PLC. My role involves designing, building, and maintaining scalable and reliable systems that manage and deliver critical product data. I work closely with my team to ensure the integrity, accessibility, and real-time availability of this data across the organisation.  </p>

        <h2>Ways I Prefer to Communicate</h2>
        <p>The following methods are ways in which to communicate with me:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <b>Email communication:</b> I prefer using email for formal communication, detailed updates, or when sharing documentation that may need to be referenced later. I believe using email provides a clear and organised way to track important information and follow-ups. I currently only use my work designated email to communicate with colleagues outside of my team.<br/>
            
            <br/><b>Instant messaging:</b> I tend to use instant messaging for quick questions, status updates, and day-to-day collaboration. Instant messaging allows for efficient, real-time communication without disrupting workflow, which I believe is ideal for staying aligned with my team at work. I use Slack and Microsoft teams to communicate daily with my team and any consumers who consume our services.<br/>
            
            <br/><b>Video calls:</b> I find video calls particularly effective for team meetings, project discussions, work demonstrations/presentations and problem-solving sessions. They allow for more personal interactions, visuals, clearer communication and a quicker way for decision-making as compared to written messages. I currently attend video calls for the majority of our team meetings, such as our daily stand-ups, sprint retrospectives, sprint planning and ad-hoc meetings.<br/>
            
            <br/><b>Face-to-Face conversations:</b> I believe face-to-face conversations also provide efficiency and the ability to foster stronger working relationships. In-person discussions are especially helpful for resolving complex issues or helps to align shared goals quickly among team members. We usually have face-to-face meetings every fortnight when myself and the team go to the office for our office working day.<br/>
        </ul>
