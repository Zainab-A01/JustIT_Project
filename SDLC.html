        <h1 class="intro-title">Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
        The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process that software teams follow to create applications. It helps make sure that the software is built properly, meets the needs of users and is delivered on time and within budget. The SDLC helps teams stay organised, avoid mistakes, and deliver high-quality software.</p>

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Planning</span></h2>
        <p>This is the first and most important stage. At this phase, the team talks with clients and users to understand what they need from the software and all the features and expectations are clearly covered. The team also checks if the project is feasible in terms of cost, technology and time. A document is created to summarise expectations and requirements. Approval is then sought after, before moving forward.</p>

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Requirements</span></h2>
        <p>Once the requirements are clear, the planning begins. Project managers create a plan that includes what needs to be done, how long it will take, what resources are needed and how to handle any risks associated. This plan acts as a guide for the whole project and team.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Design</span></h2>
        <p>At this stage, the softwareâ€™s structure is planned out. The team creates a high-level design showing how the system will work and how different parts will connect. Then, a more detailed design is created to explain how each part will be built. This helps ensure the software will be secure, easy to maintain and meet the requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Development</span></h2>
        <p>The actual coding begins at this stage. Developers write the code based on the design documents provided. The work is usually split into smaller pieces and different team members handle different parts. The team follows coding standards and uses tools to track changes. Code is reviewed regularly to catch problems early.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Testing</span></h2>
        <p>Once the software is built, it needs to be tested. Testers check the software to make sure it works as expected and it doesn't have bugs. Different types of testing are done. Unit testing is used to check individual parts, integration testing is used to check how parts work together and user acceptance testing are used to check whether it meets user needs. This ensures the software is reliable, secure and performs well.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Deployment</span></h2>
        <p>After successful testing, the software is ready to go live. It is moved to the production environment where real users can access it. The deployment might be done all at once or in phases, depending on the agreed strategy. The team ensures everything runs smoothly during this process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Maintenance</span></h2>
        <p>After the software is launched; the team fixes any bugs that appear, makes updates based on user feedback and ensures the system stays secure and performs well over time. Maintenance helps keep the software useful and up to date.</p>
